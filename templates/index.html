      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
       I am a Computer Science enthusiast, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science from KNIPSS College, Sultanpur, with an expected graduation in 2026.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completed my higher secondary education in 2022 and secondary schooling in 2020, with a strong academic foundation in science and technology. These early academic experiences helped shape my interest in how computers work and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        My fascination with technology drives my passion for coding, exploring emerging tech trends, and creating smart, practical solutions to modern challenges. I am consistently working to improve my skills in programming, problem-solving, and software development, while diving deeper into cutting-edge fields like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.
      </p>
      <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring simulation games, reading tech articles, discovering new ideas through YouTube, and staying up-to-date with the fast-paced world of innovation. I believe that the best way to grow is through consistency, curiosity, and a strong growth mindset — striving every day to become a better version of myself.
      </p>
      <p>My long-term goal is to become a skilled and impactful developer who contributes meaningfully to the tech community and builds solutions that make a difference.
      </p>
